# ChessConsoleGame

Its a pretty simple straight forward game that runs in the console.

You're supposed to either use raster fonts or use Consolas and set the size to 9.. // I think made the font change size using code by default so you may not have to.

To load, you have to type in the name of the saved file. Which you can create by hand too btw.. for reference look at the New.txt,, which you can type in for loading to start 
a new game. Dont have to type in the extension.
-- Double dashes represent empty space, the smaller letters are for white and capital letters for black, and the number at the start is for turn, 0 is for white I think and 1 for black

finally have fun, all the standard rules of chess apply except any time limit.. and most of the functionality is present. I removed the en passant because I implemented it early on and changed alot later, and never re-instated it. 

thats it, have fun. Its a very basic game. You would probably get bored quickly but I had fun making it so, have fun playing it.
